Running a Colab notebook involves several steps, from setting up your environment to executing cells and saving results. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:
1. Accessing Google Colab

    Open Google Colab:
        Go to Google Colab.

    Sign In:
        If you're not already signed in, you will need to log in with your Google account.

2. Opening a Colab Notebook

    Open an Existing Notebook:
        Click on the "File" menu.
        Select "Open notebook."
        Choose from the available options: "Recent," "Google Drive," "GitHub," or "Upload."
  3 . Running Cells

    Execute Code Cells:
        Click on a code cell and press Shift + Enter to run it.
        You can also click the play button on the left side of the cell.
or: 
    Execute Markdown Cells:
        Markdown cells do not need execution but can be rendered by running other code cells or by clicking "Run all" in the "Runtime" menu.
or:
    Run All Cells:
        To execute all cells in the notebook sequentially, go to the "Runtime" menu and select "Run all."
